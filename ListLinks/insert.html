<h1>Adding Insert(s)</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Peel off about 2"-4" of outer film of insert all the way around on both sides.</li>
    <li>Make sure there are no imperfections such as scratches, scuffs, etc. on the insert.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Airlock</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Confirm insert measurements, making note of which is top and which is bottom.</li>
    <li>Place both inserts on top of the inner flange of 2" J metal. Make sure the insert does not overlap the inner flange all along the edge of the insert.</li>
    <li>The top side of the bottom insert, and the bottom side of the top insert, should meet at 48 inches up from the bottom of the frame. Mark 47" and 49" from the bottom of the panel on both sides. The crossbar will sit inside these marks.</li>
    <li>There may be only one insert for some panels, refer to excels to confirm if the panel will get a single, or 2 inserts, and what material those inserts should be.
    </li>
</ul>
