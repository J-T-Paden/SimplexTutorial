<h1>Adding the crossbar</h1>
<h2>Airlock</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Once the insert(s) have been placed, peel off red film from 2" red killer tape.</li>
    <li>Place the crossbar in between the 47" and 49" marks on the sides of the panel. Stick it to the inserts and ensure the insert has not shifted.</li>
    <li>Using a 1/8" bit, drill inside the 2 crossbar holes on each side of the crossbar. Be sure not to drill through the whole panel, only through the insert and first later of metal under the insert, or the flange of the 2" J</li>
    <li>Use a Phillips 2 bit to secure a screw inside all 4 of the crossbar holes. Ensure the inserts have not shifted off the inner flange of the 2" J.</li>
</ul>
<h2>797</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add crossbar keys to the rectangular holes on the edges of the crossbar. They may need to be filed down to fit inside.</li>
    <li>After the bottom insert has been placed, slide the crossbar over the insert.</li>
    <li>Pull out the crossbar keys until they are against the inside of the frame.</li>
    <li> Add the second insert, sliding it into the empty side of the crossbar, and then set the insert inside the frame. Sometimes the inserts need to be trimmed down with a jigsaw before they will fit inside the frame.</li>
</ul>
