<h1>Preparing and Adding Spline</h1>
<h2> Airlock</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Measure from the top inside edge of the frame to the top of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>Measure from the bottom inside edge of the frame to the bottom of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>Grab a piece of spline, either a scrap piece longer than the taken measurement, or a new piece.</li>
    <h3>Saw directions</h3>
    <p>To cut 45° angle, rotate the saw blade to your left, so the blade is to the left of 90° miter cut angle or the 0° miter saw angle. /</p>
    <p>To cut a 135° angle, rotate the saw blade to your right, so the blade is to the right of the 90° miter cut angle or the 0° miter saw angle. \</p>
    <h3>Ends</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First cut the right side of the spline piece at a 45° angle</li>
        <li>Measure from the right side to the end of your measurement and mark the spline. Extend the mark across the spline at the correct angle if necessary.</li>
        <li>Cut the spline at your mark at a 135° angle, opposite angle as step 1, cut an extra 1/16" - 1/8" longer than your measurement to not accidentally cut too short.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sides</h3>
    <h4>Top right and bottom left sides</h4>
