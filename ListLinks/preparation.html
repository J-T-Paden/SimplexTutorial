<h1>Preparation</h1>
<p>
    Start by referring to your excels to find the measurements of your top and bottom end bars. Label the top end bar with the letter of the panel to be built, add corner keys to the top and bottom end bars then store them until they are ready for building.

<h2>Airlock</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Begin preparing the crossbars by labeling each crossbar with the panel letter.</li>
    <li>Use excels to determine which crossbar will be used for which panel.</li>
    <li>Use the Airlock crossbar jig to mark 2 holes on each side of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>Make sure these holes are aligned straight with each other and the crossbar.</li>
    <li>Drill holes with a 13/64" bit, use lubrication if needed.</li>
    <li>Countersink the holes until the crossbar screw fits flush inside the hole.</li>
    <li>If the panel takes 2 inserts, use 2" red killer double-sided tape to the back of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>If the panel takes 2 inserts, mark holes equally along the length of the crossbar to later attach the beauty bar. These holes should be 5/8" from the bottom of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>If the panel takes 2 inserts, attach 2" red killer double-sided tape to the back of the beauty bar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>797</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Begin preparing the crossbars by labeling each crossbar with the panel letter.</li>
    <li>Use excels to determine which crossbar will be used for which panel.</li>
    <li>Use the 797 crossbar jig and a center punch to mark where the holes will be on the crossbar.</li>
    <li>The holes will be drilled at a later step.</li>
    <li>Use the router to inset the edges of the crossbar.</li>
    <li>Mark spline holes and drill using 797 drill press. The holes should be 1/4" on the bottom, 5/8" on the top.</li>
</ul>
